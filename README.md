# Stock Investment Tracker
![alt text](docs/icon-image.png)
## About

This program graphically demonstrates how much money you could have earned from different stocks over time.  
It's an excellent tool for practicing Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and learning more about various stocks.  

*Note: This code was primarily generated by Claude, with some fixes and enhancements.*

## Features

- **Investment Simulation**: Calculate potential earnings based on historical stock data.  
- **Customizable Inputs**: Choose any stock ticker, monthly investment amount, investment day, and investment period.  
- **Visual Representation**: Interactive charts to visualize your investment growth over time.  

## Example

Imagine you work as a programmer and can afford to set aside $1,000 per month to invest in something like the S&P 500. With this tool, you can see how much money you could have accumulated up to today. Just input:  

- **Ticker Symbol**: For example, `SPY` for the S&P 500 ETF.
- **Monthly Investment Amount**: `$1,000`.
- **Investment Day**: The day of the month you plan to invest (e.g., when your salary arrives).
- **Investment Period**: Number of months backward from today.

The program will calculate your potential earnings and display them graphically.
